# ActionPotentialVisualization
D3 animation of a neuron's dendritic voltage during the action potential event.


First Version: neuronindex1.html

Feedback on neuronindex1_5.html:

  "Graph should have axes, label, etc, and draw the lines at important neuron events (action potential, resting state) when you highlight a time index at that state, rather than having them there all the time. Label the line with the state name, and label the dots with the number to make it more readable. Also, make the dots bigger." - Reviewer 1
  
  "Make the neuron closer to the graph and slow the animation down - its hard to follow the graph change and the animation. And maybe use two buttons - one to play the animation, one to reveal all steps with some explanatory text?" - Reviewer 2
